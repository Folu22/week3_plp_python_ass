# Function and Loops and Conditional statement 

## Functions
Functions are reusable code in python, whcih makes it possible to avoid repetition of the same steps overtime.

## Loops
Loops makes it possible to iterate over a range of things overtime, we have for loop and while loop
    * For loop: This makes you loop over a statement over a period of time, it is used when you know the number of time you want to loop over a certain statement.
    * While loop: This also works like for loop, that is you can loop over a statement until the conditon is no longer True, it is used when you don't kow the number of times you want to loop over a statement.

## Conditonal Statment
Conditional statement is a way for program to make decisions and run certain pieces of code only when specific conditions are ture. for instance; if this is true, do this... otherwise, do something else.
Main Condititonal Statement in Python:
1. if - Runs code only if a conditions is true.
2. elif(short for else if) - Checks another conditions if the previous if(or elif) was false.
3. else - Runs code if nono of the previous conditions were true.
